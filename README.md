This is a Private Discord bot for my friends' server, developed in Python3. It has some fun and useful commands related to cover projects that we decide to do.

### What I Learned
<ul>
  <li> Used <code>discord.py</code> and Discord Objects to access various information for server members, roles, etc.</li>
  <li> Implemented Google Sheets as a database â€” using <code>gspread</code> library to read and write data
  <li> Extracted information from tweets using <code>tweepy</code> and Twitter API
  <li> Practiced object-oriented design
</ul>
